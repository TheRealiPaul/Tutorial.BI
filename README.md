# Tutorial.BI

The goal of this tutorial is to learn about Power BI and its functions.

Also, I want to familiarize myself with the interface.


## How to use it 

- Install [**PowerBI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-ca/) from Microsoft ; 
- Download [tuto financial sample.pbix](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962) from Microsoft ;
- Open PowerBI ;
- Click on `Import data from Excel` ;
- Browse to the download file and select it ;
- Select `financials` ;
- Enjoy.

Here is an example of my try on Power BI:
